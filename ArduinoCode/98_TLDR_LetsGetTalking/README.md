## Introduction
98_TLDR_LetsGetTalking.ino is TLDR code for https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/CforArduinoClass/tree/master/02_LetsGetTalking<br>
The comparable 02_LetsGetTalking.ino is at https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/CforArduinoClass/tree/master/ArduinoCode/02_LetsGetTalking

This was an earlier version of 02_LetsGetTalking.ino. The main difference is that it has a bunch more Serial.print*() statements to show many mathematical expressions.

I decided that this was going too deep for the beginner C/C++ class.
